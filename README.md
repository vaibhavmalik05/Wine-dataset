# About Dataset

## Description:

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones)

The objective is to predict the quality of wine.
The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.

### This data frame contains the following columns:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\
1 - fixed acidity\
2 - volatile acidity\
3 - citric acid\
4 - residual sugar\
5 - chlorides\
6 - free sulfur dioxide\
7 - total sulfur dioxide\
8 - density\
9 - pH\
10 - sulphates\
11 - alcohol\
Output variable (based on sensory data):\
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
